Step 4: Release the BMS
=======================

Scenarios
---------

If you no longer require the BMS, you can release it to avoid consuming the BMS quota.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the Cloud Server Console.

#. In the navigation pane, choose **Bare Metal Server**.

#. In the upper left corner, click |image1| and select a region.

#. In the BMS list, locate **bms-7676-nginx**. Click **More** in the **Operation** column and select **Delete** from the drop-down list.

#. In the displayed dialog box, confirm the information and click **OK**.

   If the BMS has associated resources, such as EVS disks and EIP, you can choose whether to delete these resources.

Result
------

The deleted BMS will no longer be displayed in the BMS list.
