Private Image Overview
======================

A private image is an image available only to the user who created it. It contains an OS, preinstalled public applications, and a user's private applications. You can create a private image in the following ways:

-  :ref:`Creating a Private Image from a BMS <en-us_topic_0084807532>`
-  :ref:`Creating a Private Image from an External Image File <en-us_topic_0078468105>`

After a private image is created successfully, the image status becomes **Normal**. You can use the image to create BMSs or share the image with other tenants. The following figure shows how to use private images.
