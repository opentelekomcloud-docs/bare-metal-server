Adding Tags
===========

Tags are used to identify cloud resources, such as instances, images, and disks. If you have multiple types of cloud resources which are associated with each other, you can add tags to the resources to classify and manage them easily. For more information, see :ref:`Overview <en-us_topic_0157874334>`.

You can add tags to a BMS in either of the following ways:

-  :ref:`Add Tags During BMS Creation <en-us_topic_0110378367__section125012913114>`
-  :ref:`Add Tags on the BMS Details Page <en-us_topic_0110378367__section14780204519234>`
