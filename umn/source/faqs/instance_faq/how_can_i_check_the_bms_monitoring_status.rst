How Can I Check the BMS Monitoring Status?
==========================================

The BMS monitoring software is installed in the **/usr/local/telescope** directory. Logs are in the **/usr/local/telescope/log/** directory, in which **ces.log** is the data log and **common.log** is the run log.

-  If data is not sent successfully and **403** or **401** is returned, check whether **AccessKey** and **SecretKey** are specified correctly.
-  If data is not sent successfully and **500** or other codes are returned, contact the customer service.
