How Do I Create a BMS That Can be Quickly Provisioned?
======================================================

When you create a common BMS (that is, a BMS booted from a local disk), its OS needs to be downloaded from the cloud and it also takes some time to install the OS. When you create a BMS that uses an EVS as its system disk, the OS has been installed on the disk and does not need to be downloaded or installed. In this way, the BMS can be provisioned within a short time when you apply for it.

On the page for creating a BMS, select a flavor that supports quick BMS provisioning, set the system disk type and capacity, and configure other required parameters.
