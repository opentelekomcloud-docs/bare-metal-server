What Are the Advanced Features of BMSs Using EVS Disks?
=======================================================

BMSs that use EVS disks as their system disks can be provisioned within a shorter time, which facilitates quick service recovery.

Such BMSs have the following advanced features:

-  BMSs booted from EVS disks can be provisioned within about 5 minutes.
-  CSBS backups ensure data security.
-  BMS rebuilding upon faults is supported, enabling quick service recovery.
-  An image of a BMS can be exported to apply configurations of the BMS to other BMSs, eliminating the need to repeatedly configure BMSs.
