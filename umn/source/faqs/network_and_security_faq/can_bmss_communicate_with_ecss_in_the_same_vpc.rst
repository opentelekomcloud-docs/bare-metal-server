Can BMSs Communicate with ECSs in the Same VPC?
===============================================

Yes. BMSs can communicate with ECSs in the same VPC.

Your VPC may consist of multiple network segments. If the BMSs and ECSs are in the same segment, they communicate with each other through the Layer 2 network. If they are in different segments, they communicate with each other through the Layer 3 network.

In addition, you must configure security group rules for the BMSs to communicate with the ECSs. In addition, to enable an ECS to access a Windows BMS, disable the firewall of Windows.
