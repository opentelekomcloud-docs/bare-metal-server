How Can I Modify the Network Configuration or Restart the Network If I Can Log In to a BMS Using Only SSH?
==========================================================================================================

The network automatically allocated by the BMS cannot be modified. If you modify the network configuration, you may fail to log in to the BMS. If the BMS has a NIC of the user-defined VLAN, you can configure or modify the network to which the NIC connects.
