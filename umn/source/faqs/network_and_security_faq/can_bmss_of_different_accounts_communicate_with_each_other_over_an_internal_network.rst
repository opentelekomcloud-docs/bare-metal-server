Can BMSs of Different Accounts Communicate with Each Other over an Internal Network?
====================================================================================

Generally, BMSs of different accounts cannot communicate with each other for security concerns.

However, if you do need to allow BMSs of different accounts to communicate with each other through an internal network, you can create a VPC peering connection between VPCs in different accounts. For details, see *Virtual Private Cloud User Guide*.
