Can I Install or Upgrade BMS OSs by Myself?
===========================================

You can reinstall a BMS OS. If an upgrade or patch installation is involved and the kernel version changes, confirm with the cloud service vendor whether drivers, such as RAID controller card drivers and NIC drivers, need to be reinstalled. If the required drivers of the corresponding kernel version are not installed, the OS may fail to start or basic functions of the OS may be unavailable.
