Can I Install or Upgrade BMS OSs by Myself?
===========================================

You can reinstall a BMS OS. If the kernel is upgraded, confirm with the cloud service vendor whether certain services (for example, network service) and hardware drivers (such as RAID controller card drivers and NIC drivers) need to be upgraded accordingly. If the service packages or drivers are not upgraded to match the kernel version, the OS may fail to start or basic functions of the OS may be unavailable.
