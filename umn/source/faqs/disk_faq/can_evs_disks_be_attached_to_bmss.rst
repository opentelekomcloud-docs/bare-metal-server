Can EVS Disks Be Attached to BMSs?
==================================

Yes. Ultra-high I/O, high I/O, and common I/O EVS disks can be attached to BMSs.

.. note::

   If you need to attach an EVS disk to an existing BMS, **Device Type** of the EVS disk must be **SCSI**. If you need to create an EVS disk and attach it to the BMS, you must select **SCSI** in **Advanced Settings** when you create the EVS disk.
