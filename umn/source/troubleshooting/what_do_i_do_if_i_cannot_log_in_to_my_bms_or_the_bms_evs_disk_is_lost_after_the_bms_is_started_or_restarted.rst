What Do I Do If I Cannot Log In to My BMS or the BMS EVS Disk Is Lost After the BMS Is Started or Restarted?
============================================================================================================

Symptom
-------

After a BMS is started or restarted, the user cannot log in to the BMS or the BMS EVS disk is lost.

Possible Causes
---------------

The BMS cannot obtain the IP address or the EVS disk cannot be attached to the BMS because packet loss caused by network congestion occurs.

Solution
--------

Restart the BMS. If the fault still persists after you have restarted the BMS for several times, contact the operation administrator.
