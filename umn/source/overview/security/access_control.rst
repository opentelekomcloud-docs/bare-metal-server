Access Control
==============

Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides functions such as user identity authentication, permission assignment, and access control. You can use IAM to securely control user access to your BMSs.

-  Account security

   If you are an enterprise administrator, you can use IAM to create a user and grant permissions to the user. Enterprise employees can use the user account to access the system, and you do not need to share your account password or key pair with them. This helps you manage resources efficiently. You can also configure account security policies to protect these user accounts and reduce security risks for your enterprise information.

-  Fine-grained authorization

   You can grant refined operation rights to employee accounts to ensure that cloud services are properly used.

IAM also provides functions such as intra-region resource isolation and delegation. For details, see *Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
