License Type
============

Use License from the System
---------------------------

You can use OS licenses provided by the cloud platform. You need to pay for the licenses which are billed on a pay-as-you-go basis. The licenses are managed by the cloud platform.

Bring Your Own License (BYOL)
-----------------------------

**What Is BYOL?**

Bring Your Own License (BYOL) allows you to use your own OS licenses. You do not need to pay for the licenses but need to manage them by yourself.

**How Can I Use BYOL?**

If you choose BYOL, you need to manage licenses by yourself. The cloud platform provides functions you need for maintaining license compliance during the lifecycle of your license.

**Application Scenarios**

You can choose BYOL when you create a BMS.

The system will not allow you to change the license type after you create the BMS.
