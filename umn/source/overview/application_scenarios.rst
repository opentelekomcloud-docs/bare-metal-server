Application Scenarios
=====================

Database
--------

Mission-critical database services of governments and financial institutions must be deployed on physical servers with dedicated resources, isolated networks, and guaranteed performance. The BMS service properly meets these database service requirements by providing high-performance servers dedicated for individual users.

Big Data
--------

For Internet services involving big data storage and analysis, the BMS service provides both local storage and compute-storage decoupling backed by OBS.

Container
---------

Containers enable elastic load balancing for Internet services. BMSs provide more agile container deployment with higher density and lower resource overhead than VMs. Cloud native technologies reduce the cost of cloud transformation.

HPC/AI
------

In high-performance computing (HPC) such as supercomputing, DNA sequencing, and AI, a large amount of data needs to be processed. The BMS service meets the requirements of HPC services for high computing performance, high stability, and high real-time performance of servers.
