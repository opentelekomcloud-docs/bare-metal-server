BMS Advantages
==============

High Security and Reliability
-----------------------------

BMS allows you to use dedicated computing resources, add servers to VPCs and security groups for network isolation, and integrate related components for server security. BMS can interconnect with dedicated storage to ensure the data security and reliability required by enterprise services.

High Performance
----------------

BMS has no virtualization overhead, allowing dedicated computing resources for service running. BMS can use high-bandwidth, low-latency storage and networks on the cloud, meeting the deployment density and performance requirements of critical services such as enterprise databases, big data, containers, HPC, and AI.

AnyStack on BMS
---------------

Compatible with various mainstream hypervisors such as VMware, Citrix XenServer, Xen, KVM, and Hyper-V, BMS allows you to quickly and smoothly migrate virtualization services from on-premises data centers to the cloud. BMS provides consistent online and offline cloud management experience, meeting requirements for hybrid cloud and multi-cloud deployment.

Quick Provisioning and Unified O&M
----------------------------------

The required BMSs can be provisioned within minutes after you submit an order. You can manage your BMSs through their lifecycle from the management console or using open APIs with SDKs.

Quick Integration of Cloud Services and Solutions
-------------------------------------------------

Based on the unified VPC model, cloud services and cloud solutions (such as database, big data, container, HPC, and AI solutions) can be quickly integrated to run on BMSs. This accelerates cloud transformation.
