OSs Supported by Different Types of BMSs
========================================

The following tables list the 64-bit OSs supported by different BMS types.

:ref:`Table 1 <en-us_topic_0263802108__table188617221012>` lists the OSs supported by I/O optimized physical.i7n.28xlarge.4 BMSs.

.. note::

   -  It is recommended that you use the official OS release versions. Do not tailor or customize the release versions, or problems may occur.
   -  OS vendors do not always update OS release versions regularly. Some versions are no longer maintained, and these deprecated versions no longer receive security patches. Ensure that you read the update notifications from OS vendors and update your OS so that it runs properly.
