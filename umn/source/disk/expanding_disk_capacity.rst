Expanding Disk Capacity
=======================

If a disk does not have sufficient capacity, you can expand its capacity. Both the system disk and data disk can be expanded. The maximum size of a system disk is 1 TB. For details about how to expand the disk capacity, see "Expansion Overview" in *Elastic Volume Service User Guide*.

.. important::

   The system disk capacity of a Windows BMS that is quickly provisioned cannot be expanded. If you need to expand the capacity, contact technical support.

After the capacity expansion is successful, allocate the partition for the extended space of the DSS disk.

-  For details about the follow-up operations after a system disk is expanded, see "Extending Disk Partitions and File Systems (Windows)" or "Extending Partitions and File Systems for System Disks (Linux)" in *Elastic Volume Service User Guide*.
-  For details about the follow-up operations after a data disk is expanded, see "Extending Disk Partitions and File Systems (Windows)" or "Extending Partitions and File Systems for SCSI Disks (Linux)" in *Elastic Volume Service User Guide*.
