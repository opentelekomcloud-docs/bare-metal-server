Initializing a Linux Data Disk (fdisk)
======================================

Scenarios
---------

This section uses CentOS 7.0 64-bit as an example.

The maximum disk capacity supported by MBR is 2 TB, and that supported by GPT is 18 EB. Therefore, use the GPT partition style if your disk capacity is greater than 2 TB. In Linux OSs, if the GPT partition style is used, the fdisk partitioning tool cannot be used. The parted partitioning tool must be used. For details about disk partition styles, see :ref:`Introduction to Data Disk Initialization Scenarios and Partition Styles <en-us_topic_0157011194>`.

The method for initializing a disk varies depending on the OSs running on the BMS. This document is for reference only. For detailed operations and differences, see the product documents of the OSs running on the corresponding BMSs.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  You have logged in to the BMS.
-  A data disk has been attached to the BMS and has not been initialized.

Create Partitions and Attach a Disk
-----------------------------------

The following example shows how to use fdisk to create a primary partition on a data disk that has been attached to the BMS. The default partitioning style is MBR and the default file system format is **ext4**. Mount the file system to **/mnt/sdc**, and configure automatic mounting upon system start.

#. Run the following command to query information about the added data disk:

   **fdisk** **-l**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block:: console

      [root@bms-b656 test]# fdisk -l

      Disk /dev/sda: 42.9 GB, 42949672960 bytes, 83886080 sectors
      Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
      Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
      I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
      Disk label type: dos

      Disk /dev/sdb: 10.7 GB, 10737418240 bytes, 20971520 sectors

      Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
      I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

   The command output shows that the BMS has two disks, system disk **/dev/sda** and data disk **/dev/sdb**.

#. Run the following command to use fdisk to perform the partitioning operations for the added data disk:

   **fdisk** *Newly added data disk*

   For example, run the following command to use fdisk to perform the partitioning operations for the **/dev/sdb** data disk:

   **fdisk** **/dev/sdb**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block:: console

   The newly created **/dev/sdb1** is mounted on **/mnt/sdc**.

Set Automatic Disk Attachment Upon BMS Start
--------------------------------------------

To automatically attach a disk when a BMS starts, you should not specify its partition, for example **/dev/sdb1**, in **/etc/fstab**. This is because the sequence of cloud devices may change during the server start or stop process, for example, from **/dev/sdb** to **/dev/sdc**. You are advised to use the universally unique identifier (UUID) in **/etc/fstab** to automatically attach a disk at system start.

.. note::

   The universally unique identifier (UUID) is the unique character string for disk partitions in a Linux system.

#. Run the following command to query the partition UUID:

   **blkid** *Disk partition*

   For example, run the following command to query the UUID of **/dev/sdb1**:

   **blkid** **/dev/sdb1**

   Information similar to the following is displayed:

   .. code-block:: console

      [root@bms-b656 test]# blkid /dev/sdb1
      /dev/sdb1: UUID="1851e23f-1c57-40ab-86bb-5fc5fc606ffa" TYPE="ext4"

   The UUID of **/dev/sdb1** is displayed.

#. Run the following command to open the **fstab** file using the vi editor:

   **vi** **/etc/fstab**

#. Press **i** to enter the editing mode.

#. Move the cursor to the end of the file and press **Enter**. Then add the following information:

   .. code-block::

      UUID=1851e23f-1c57-40ab-86bb-5fc5fc606ffa /mnt/sdc      ext4 defaults     0   2

#. Press **Esc**, enter **:wq**, and press **Enter**.

   The system saves the configurations and exits the vi editor.
