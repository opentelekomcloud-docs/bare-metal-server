Overview
========

Scenario
--------

Cloud-Init is a tool developed to initiate VMs or BMSs in the cloud environment. It is used to configure the network, hostname, hosts file, username, and password when a user uses images to create VMs or BMSs. Cloud-Init is also required if the password of a VM created by using images is to be generated by the system at random.

In other cases, Cloud-Init is not required. The Cloud-Init installation file has requirements on Linux versions and can only be installed from the Internet. Therefore, ensure that the VM can access the Internet.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  You have logged in to the VM.
-  The host can connect to the Internet.
-  You have logged in to the host using VNC Viewer and installed an OS on the host using virt-manager.

Description
-----------
