Uninstalling denyhosts
======================

Check whether denyhosts has been installed. If it is installed, uninstall it. This is because denyhosts may cause functional problems, for example, SSH login failure.

Run the following commands to query and uninstall denyhosts:

**rpm -qa \| grep denyhosts**

**rpm -e** **denyhosts**
