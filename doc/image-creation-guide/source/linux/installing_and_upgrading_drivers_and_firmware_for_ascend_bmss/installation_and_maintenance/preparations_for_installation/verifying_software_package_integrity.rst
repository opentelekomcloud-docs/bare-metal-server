Verifying Software Package Integrity
====================================

To prevent a software package from being maliciously tampered with during transmission or storage, download the corresponding digital signature file for integrity verification while downloading the software package.

After software packages are downloaded, verify their PGP digital signatures by following *OpenPGP Signature Verification Guide*. If the verification fails, do not use the software packages. Contact technical support.

Before a software package is used for installation or upgrade, its digital signature needs to be verified by following instructions provided in the signature verification guide to ensure that the software package is not tampered with.
