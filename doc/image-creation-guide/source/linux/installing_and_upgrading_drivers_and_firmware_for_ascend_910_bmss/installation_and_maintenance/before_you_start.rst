Before You Start
================

For BMSs with Ascend 910 Pro B or Ascend 910 Premium NPU, install NPU driver 20.2.0.spc300 or later versions. NPU firmware is released with the driver. If you install the NPU driver or firmware again, you can only install a version no earlier than the current one.

To query the NPU name, log in to the OS and run **npu-smi info**.

Alternatively, you can query the NPU name in iBMC. Log in to the iBMC WebUI, choose **System** > **System Info**, and click **Processors** to view NPU details.
