XenServer 7.1
=============

When you configure the storage during XenServer installation, select the item shown in the red box in the following figure. In addition, this OS does not support automatic disk capacity. You are advised to set the system disk capacity to around 100 GB to ensure sufficient root partition capacity after the VM is provisioned. Configure other parameters as needed.
