API Instructions
================

-  For details about network service APIs, see *Virtual Private Cloud API Reference*.
-  When using BMS APIs, you need to use endpoints. For details, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/regions-and-endpoints/index.html>`__.
-  When using native OpenStack APIs for SSH key management, use the endpoints of the ECS service because BMS does not have endpoints for these APIs.
